# JustAnotherHTTPServer

JustAnotherHTTPServer is a simple HTTP server implemented in Python. This project demonstrates the basic functionality of serving static HTML files over a TCP connection.

## Features

- Serves static HTML files (`index.html`, `hello.html`).
- Simple HTTP request handling.
- Basic routing to handle different HTTP methods.
- Error handling for unsupported methods and missing files.

## Files

- **`main.py`**: Contains the implementation of the TCP and HTTP server.
- **`index.html`**: The default homepage served by the HTTP server.
- **`hello.html`**: A simple "Hello" page served by the HTTP server.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Implement Full HTTP Support**
  - Expand support for more HTTP methods (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE), headers, cookies, and caching.

- [ ] **Serve Multiple Clients**
  - Modify the server to handle multiple client connections using multi-threading or event-driven models.

- [ ] **Add WSGI Support**
  - Implement WSGI to make the server compatible with frameworks like Django and Flask.

- [ ] **Enable Daemon Mode**
  - Allow the server to run in the background as a daemon process.

- [ ] **Implement Logging**
  - Add logging for access requests and error tracking.

- [ ] **Add Configuration Support**
  - Implement a configuration system to manage server settings like file serving and URL mapping.

- [ ] **Serve Large Files Efficiently**
  - Improve handling of large files using chunked transfer encoding.

- [ ] **Enhance Security**
  - Implement security best practices and regularly update measures to protect against vulnerabilities.
